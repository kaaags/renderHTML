	<p>The only way some people can find a purpose in life is by becoming obsessed with <b>demons</b>. In my world, we have people in chains, and we can ride them like ponies. It eats you, starting with your bottom. <u>I've got four brothers, none of them Democrats</u>. Hey I could whip up a love slave any day I wanted. No need, little lady, your tears of gratitude are enough for me.</p>
	<p>Risk the pain, it is your nature. Oh my god! Did it sing? Easy as really difficult pie.. I dislike that Anya. <i>She's newly human and strangely literal.</i> Battle wounds are nothing new to me, preacher. One of my personalities happens to be a multiple personality, but that doesn't make me a multiple personality. See, morbid and creepifying, I got no problem with, long as she does it quiet-like.</p>
